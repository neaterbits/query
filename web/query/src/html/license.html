	<br/>
	<br/>
	Licenses will be available for commercial use at this point, while a dual open source license scheme may be possible in the future.
	<br/>
	The main reasons for this are:
	
	 <ul>
	   <li>Livable income necessary to provide new features</li>
	   <li>Dual licensing (commercial/GPL) requires a bit more research but is likely the way to go</li>
	   <li>Keeping the API consistent, completely open sourcing at this relatively early stage could quickly create multiple incompatible variants.</li> 
	   <li>Open sourcing at a relatively stage could have someone fork the project and get all the mindshare for their forked version</li> 
	 </ul>
