	<br/>
	Licenses will be available for commercial use at this point, while a dual open source license scheme may be possible in the future.
	<br/>
	The main reasons for this are:
	
	 <ul>
	   <li>Eat and pay rent. A stable source of income is necessary to provide you with new features, that may be dual licensed later.</li>
	   <li>Dual licensing (commercial/GPL) requires a bit more research but is likely the way to go</li>
	   <li>Keeping the API consistent, completely open sourcing at this relatively early stage could quickly create multiple incompatible variants.</li> 
	 </ul>
